# input: a string
# output: an array of all substrings from a given string
# rules:
#       Explicit requirements:
#         - every palindrome must be returned as separate strings in an array
#         - if there are no palindromes it should return an empty array
#         - an empty string should return an empty array
#         - palindromes are case sensitive ex. Dad is not a palindrome but dad is
